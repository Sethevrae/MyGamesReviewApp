                      ArcheAge&nbsp;is an MMORPG in from Korean company&nbsp;XLGames&nbsp;and
                      published in the NA and EU by Trion Worlds. Players enter a fantasy world
                      and start play on one of two continents: Nuia (Elves), and Harihara (Ferres).
                      From there, everything else is up to you, from what character you play,
                      to where you go, and why. ArcheAge promises to remove the restrictions
                      that have hampered former MMORPGs, especially concerning character classes
                      and skills. Go where you will, do what you want, be the character you want
                      to be.

                  This one's most likely not going to happen, at least by release. Player
                  housing is a rare feature in new MMOs these days, and customizing it with
                  anything more than "hooks" to place objects on is even rarer. Even Star
                  Wars Galaxies' housing lacks this. Horizons/Istaria had fairly customizable
                  housing, allowing at least for general appearance (do you want a fence?
                  Perhaps pillars leading up to the front door?) as opposed to picking out
                  where doors and windows go, but that game is almost primarily a game for
                  crafting and economics. This feature isn't impossible to pull off, but
                  most likely will play second to combat mechanics.

                  <br>
                  Like the previous example, this feature probably won't make it to launch,
                  if at all, but for different reasons. While the concept isn't new, it can
                  be rather complicated, since the server will have another thing to load
                  (this is why many games made to support tons of players tend to be low
                  on customization options- more options means more loading and more lag).
                  In addition, devs have to watch out for things like "penis textures" to
                  weed out potentially offensive art. All this takes a lot of time away from
                  perfecting game play basics, but can add a lot to the quality of life of
                  the game, so I have little doubt this will eventually be implemented.

                      Contagious Diseases
                  </strong>
                  <br>
                  This is yet another feature that may not make it to release. However,
                  diseases have been in games before, and in both a known sandbox (Istaria)
                  and theme-park (World of Warcraft, both accidentally and intentionally).
                  This may not make it at release simply because it doesn't add a ton to
                  a theme park game or a sandbox, but could possibly appear in story arches
                  (assuming patches do something to move story forward, though it could just
                  be a hype point for an early patch).&nbsp;

                  <br>
                  This one will most likely make it to launch, but probably in a simple
                  form. For example, when creating some housing types, a guard or vendor
                  may be included with the blueprints, as opposed to having some option to
                  make one appear for any housing type. NC Soft had mercenary NPCs at launch,
                  but that game was highly instanced. Having NPCs you can hire for crafting
                  probably won't occur at launch, partially because of additional server
                  pressure, but also to slow down building projects so devs can assess how
                  much room players are taking up in the world. Think of the last few MMOs
                  you saw launch. Player housing itself is rarely a launch feature, especially
                  if there's already features that allow players to take over land for guild
                  housing. Xsyon recently released with both, but it's combat was severely
                  lacking. Since AA already has focused on combat, it would seem that controlling
                  the amount of land players can take control over will probably be important
                  for balance purposes (creating new areas for players to inhabit is more
                  demanding of a dev team than simply balancing resources to allow players
                  to build faster/slower).

                  </strong>
                  <br>
                  We've heard we'll have the ability to form "families," but this sounds
                  more like a last name being part of player names, similar to Darkfall's
                  "RP content." RP content is rarely at the top of a game's list, but player
                  housing and gardens will cover a large part of this, and the "labor" people
                  can build up may help encourage a reason for social interaction to occur
                  for some types of RPers. RP clothes may appear down the line (such as chef
                  hats), but for release, I can't imagine it.

                  </strong>
                  <br>
                  This one's a wild card, after looking over some of the dev chats. On the
                  one hand, it sounds like an important flexibility structure XL wants to
                  include. However, I can see this getting cut for simplicity's sake and
                  combing EF duties into existing guild structures. If it doesn't appear
                  by open beta, it most likely won't be in.

                  </strong>
                  <br>
                  This sounds rather unlikely. Debuffs/guard aggro sounds more feasible.
                  While there is some information on this, a few problems can arise, such
                  as players being put in jail and needing to log out. Players have wanted
                  a feature like this forever. If it does make it to launch, I'd guess it'd
                  come well after release. Server types help police certain scenarios where
                  this would be needed, so I can see it being shelved to work on, say, additional
                  content for theme park elements or testing siege mechanics for balance.

                      World Building
                  </strong>
                  <br>
                  Player created bridges/roads sound plausible, in that devs can implement
                  them to save themselves some time. For example, the first raid dungeon
                  could be located on a plateau that players cannot reach until they build
                  a fortified ramp to it as a gating mechanism, perhaps forcing players to
                  choose between building towns/houses/ships or unlocking content for the
                  server. No matter what players choose, unless a server has a gross amount
                  of players or the game has very little content, world building could help
                  slow down player pacing all around and function as content for sandbox
                  players. The tactic was utilized in Horizons, giving devs a little more
                  time to work on new player races and encourage players to use resources
                  they had been saving for player housing. If not present at launch, I can
                  see it being released shortly thereafter.

                  lower left-hand corner features a mini-map and compass for navigation,
                  and a simplified objective notice above it; the lower right includes a

                  shows symbols marking three kinds of entities: blue for allies, green for
                  squadmates, and red/orange for enemies, this applies to all interactivity
                  on the battlefield. Battlefield 4 options also allow colour-blind players

                  Players can use dual-scoped weapons, including weapons with different
                  firing modes (e.g. semi-automatic, automatic fire). They can "spot" targets
                  (marking their positions to the player's squad) in the single player campaign
                  (a first in the Battlefield franchise) as well as in multiplayer, allowing
                  team mates to either suppress or eliminate them. The game's bullet-dropping-system
                  has been significantly enhanced, allowing players to aim precisely with
                  the environment. In addition, players have more survival capabilities,
                  such as countering melee attacks from the front while standing or crouching,
                  shooting with their sidearm while swimming, and diving underwater to avoid
                  enemy detection.

                  The single-player campaign has several differences from the main multiplayer
                  component. For the most part, the player must traverse mini-sandbox-style
                  levels, in some cases using vehicles, like tanks and boats, to traverse
                  the environment. As the player character,&nbsp;Recker, the player can use
                  two campaign-only functions: the Engage command and the tactical binocular.
                  The Engage command directs Recker's squadmates, and occasionally other
                  friendly units, to attack any hostiles in Recker's line of sight. The tactical
                  binocular is similar to a laser-designator, in the sense that it that allows
                  the player to identify friendly and enemy units, weapon stashes, explosives,
                  and objectives in the field. By identifying enemies, the player can make
                  them visible without using the visor, making them easier to mark for their
                  teammates. At one point, Recker will briefly lose the tactical visor, forcing
                  them to only use the Engage command to direct his squadmates on a limited
                  number of enemies.

                  The campaign features assignments that require specific actions and unlock
                  weapons for use in multiplayer upon completion. Collectible weapons return
                  along with the introduction of collectible&nbsp;dog tags&nbsp;which can
                  be used in multiplayer. Weapon crates are found throughout all levels,
                  allowing players to obtain ammo and switch weapons. While crates hold default
                  weapons, collectible weapons may be used whenever they are acquired and
                  level-specific weapons may be used once a specific mission assignment has

                  On June 10, 2013, at E3, DICE featured the map "Siege of Shanghai", pitting
                  the&nbsp;People's Liberation Army&nbsp;against the&nbsp;U.S. Marine Corps.
                  The gameplay showcased Commander Mode; new weapons and vehicles; and the
                  "Levolution" gameplay mechanic. The video displays the last of these at
                  various points, including: a player destroying a support pillar to trap
                  an enemy tank above it; and a large skyscraper (with an in-game objective
                  on the top floor) collapsing in the center of the map, kicking up a massive
                  dust cloud throughout the map and bringing the objective closer to ground
                  level.&nbsp;Levolution also includes effects such as shooting a fire extinguisher
                  to fill the room with obscuring clouds, car alarms going off when stepped
                  on, metal detectors going off once passed through, or cutting the power
                  in a room to reduce others' visibility.

                  another player. The Engineer kit uses&nbsp;PDWs, and carbines are available

                  for indirect suppressive fire. The Recon kit is now far more mobile and
                  is able to equip carbines,&nbsp;designated marksman rifles&nbsp;(DMRs),
                  and C4. Sniping mechanics are also enhanced with the ability to zero in
                  your sights (set an aiming distance), and equip more optics and accessories
                  than previous Battlefield games. The Recon kit is still able to utilize

                  the player having to change camos every game. Camos can now be applied
                  to jets, helicopters, tanks, transport vehicles and guns. Previously this
                  option was introduced to parachutes but has been removed, emblems are now

                      Diablo III picks up the story twenty years after the events of Diablo
                      II. Mephisto, Diablo, and Baal have been defeated, but the Worldstone,
                      which once shielded the inhabitants of the world of Sanctuary from the
                      forces of both the High Heavens and the Burning Hells, has been destroyed,
                      and evil once again stirs in Tristram. Playing as a hero from one of five
                      distinct character classes, players acquire powerful items, spells, and
                      abilities as they explore new and familiar areas of Sanctuary and battle
                      hordes of demons to safeguard the world from the horrors that have arisen.
                      Diablo III features a custom 3D-graphics engine to render lush indoor and
                      outdoor areas of Sanctuary with a high level of detail and vivid special
                      effects. The game's physics-enhanced environments are interactive and destructible,
                      offering traps and obstacles that create added danger for players and monsters
                      alike. These elements, along with a new quest system and random scripted
                      events, have been integrated into the game’s random-level generator, giving
                      Diablo III the ultimate combination of dynamic gameplay and replayability.
                      Cooperative and competitive play are available online through an upgraded
                      version of Blizzard Entertainment’s renowned online gaming service, Battle.net.

              <p>
                  We're proud of the original Diablo's dark, moody atmosphere and engaging
                  item-grabbing gameplay. Diablo II added more environmental and monster
                  variety, more diverse classes, and a number of unique elements that have
                  since become synonymous with the franchise (like gems, runes, set items,
                  etc.).
              </p>
              <p>
                  Both games established the series' hallmarks: randomized levels, the relentless
                  onslaught of monsters and events in a perpetually fresh world, unique quests,
                  tons of items, and an epic story about the High Heavens, the Burning Hells,
                  and the hapless and heroic human beings caught between them.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Diablo III is the inheritor of this legacy, and we've added even more
                  elements to the game to keep building on our vision for the world of Sanctuary.

                  In Diablo III, runes give you unprecedented control over your skills and
                  powers, changing elemental damage types, accuracy, and area of effect;
                  adding new debilitating effects like slows and stuns; and even altering
                  the nature and appearance of your abilities.

                  Sometimes a hero needs a helping hand. Followers, champions brave enough
                  to join you in battle against the Burning Hells, are similar to Henchmen
                  from Diablo II in that they can be outfitted with relevant arms and armor,
                  but they're upgradable with their own skills, allowing you to customize
                  how they fight and what passive benefits they convey. They're also fleshed-out
                  personalities in their own right.

              <p>
                  As you meet and assist people during your journey through Sanctuary, some
                  of the world's most talented craftsmen will sign on to travel with you.
                  These artisans are capable of putting the materials you'll find in the
                  wilderness or salvage from unneeded items to good use, hammering out customized
                  suits of armor or combining gems to unlock their powers.

                  Invest time and money into an artisan's training, fill their shop with
                  worthy materials, and they'll keep improving the quality of items they
                  can produce, augment or combine for you.

                  To push Diablo's blistering fast pace even harder, we've made some changes
                  to Diablo III's character and inventory 'management' systems, so you'll
                  spend more time using new powers to slay your enemies and get loot. Rather
                  than hoarding skill points and holding off on improving your abilities
                  while you wait levels for an ideal build, Diablo III lets you "respec"
                  your skills readily to experiment with interesting choices. You can also
                  share items between all of your characters just by placing them in your
                  stash, and you can identify unknown items and teleport back to town without
                  needing to collect scrolls and tomes to do so.

                  Combat in Diablo III follows the established model of clicking on your
                  squealing, snarling enemies and watching the carnage – but it's deeper
                  and richer. Scads of defensive abilities for each class mean more tactical
                  possibilities; cooldowns on potions guarantee that choosing your targets
                  carefully and controlling the battlefield is as important as what you bring
                  with you to a fight, and the presence of health globes ensures that mobility
                  can mean the difference between life and death.

              <p>
                  There are six classes in Diablo III; five (the barbarian, witch doctor,
                  demon hunter, and monk) are veterans of the battle for Sanctuary, and the
                  crusader joins them in the Reaper of Souls expansion, boasting many, many
                  new destructive tricks for tearing through foes. Each class has a unique
                  resource system and appropriately different playstyle.

              <p>
                  Diablo III has more different, distinct monsters than Diablo I and II,
                  and these monsters all bring their own special destructive abilities, some
                  new and some familiar. The variety of Diablo III's random items is similar
                  to that of the other Diablo games (though we've included Legendary items),
                  but we've added thousands of new combinations, many with unique abilities
                  and previously unseen properties.
              </p>
              <p>
                  New weapon and equipment types, like the demon hunter's one-handed crossbows
                  and witch doctors' mojos, also provide a great deal of class-specific flavor.

                  a storied history. In Diablo III, we wanted to create a more formalized
                  play-space for heroes to test their mettle – so we decided to marry classic
                  Diablo dueling to opt-in fights in the Scorched Chapel, a zone designed
                  for brutal, fast-paced free-for-all combat.

              <p>
                  Diablo has always been a macabre take on a classic theme – the battle
                  between good and evil – set in a world of fragile people who have somehow
                  persevered through chaos and tragedy. In Diablo III, we're taking this
                  story to new heights (and depths), and exploring parts of Sanctuary we've
                  only hinted at in the past.

                  Mods will be supported, yet many of them that rewrite core code will need
                  to update to the new format. Currently, mods on a server are compatible
                  with anyone who joins the server, as long as they don't add textures or
                  sound files, otherwise, it should be fine. Furthermore, most mods that
                  only affect the HUD&nbsp;have no effect on the server and therefore will
                  be compatible with anything.

                  the flexibility that&nbsp;

                  know what twist that plot is going to take, but I’ll be down for a test-run

                  This also leads into the fact that clothing (both forged by the character
                  and looted) will change frequently between the Inquisitor and the rest
                  of the companions. And it’s not simply “change texture, vague colors” but
                  rather intricately designed armor and robe-sets. Bring out the next-gen

                  to offer an “open world” setting. Mark Derrah commented early on that the
                  game would debut a list of feasible regions:&nbsp;Fereldan, The Free Marches,
                  Orlais, Nevarra and the Dales. Returning to each region that’s been made
                  famous by the Warden and the Champion in prior games, whilst also choosing
                  to expand into alternate regions of Thedas.&nbsp;

                  This backdrop should prove to be a little reminiscent of the “Elder Scrolls”
                  series. It probably doesn’t come as a surprise that the game’s adaptation
                  into an open world setting is heavily based on&nbsp;

                  features its own set of unique characteristics—the comparison is still&nbsp;going
                  to be present. I’m excited to see what exactly is going to be brought to
                  the table. No doubt there’s going to be some rebound off previously successful
                  games in the genre, but as long as they’re mere stepping stones for the
                  creation a brand-new experience, that’ll be some satisfying progression.

                  Alongside being able to traverse at your leisure, there’s also going to
                  be a choice to acquire various mounts. Starting with a horse, of course.

                      are going to offer a spectrum of liable endings to the tale of the Inquisitor.
                      Depending on how the player has chosen to route the game itself, the end-game
                      content is going to take a swift turn. With each unique ending that is
                      unlocked, it is our hope that each will be as meaningful and fulfilling
                      as the last. Hopefully not giving way to similar endings with only slight
                      degrees of variation between them. Mark Darrah stressed the fact that the
                      basis of the upcoming game is to give the player a sense of conclusion
                      solely towards his or her own choices.

                  So yes, there will be a chance to veer in-between choices, and the final
                  outcome will be intangible until it is reached. BioWare commented that
                  there might be as many as 40, although I personally believe that number
                  is a little too steep.

                  different parts of town, have their own issues, attitudes, lifestyles,
                  desires and goals - but they do know how to work together. They also each
                  have their own unique skillsets to bring to the table when it's time to

                  The open world of Grand Theft Auto V is not just massive in scale, but
                  will offer more to get into than ever before. For recreation, play a bit
                  of golf or tennis, zen out with some yoga or cycle through the countryside...
                  For adrenaline heads, parachute over the city, or customize your Cheetah
                  and take it to the streets to race suckers for money... Or earn cash the
                  old fashioned way, by taking it - whether by ripping off liquor stores
                  or by buying and taking over businesses that will earn you dividends...
                  Even minding your own business having a stroll you may meet one of Los
                  Santos' weirdos, junkies, drunkies, or starlets and find yourself off on
                  a wild misadventure you never expected...

                  pull off grand Heists - big, multi-part missions that require careful preparation,
                  recruiting, and precise (and often explosive) execution. Cash is king in
                  GTAV and while there will be plenty of ways to acquire and spend it - heists
                  are the way to earn the big bucks.

                  with new content created by Rockstar Games and the Grand Theft Auto community.
                  Grand Theft Auto Online takes the fundamental Grand Theft Auto concepts
                  of freedom, ambient activity and mission-based gameplay and makes them
                  available to multiple players in an incredibly detailed and responsive

                  or with friends, work cooperatively to complete missions, band together
                  to participate in activities and ambient events, or compete in traditional
                  game modes with the entire community, all with the personality and refined
                  mechanics of Grand Theft Auto V.

                  improving their stats, owning customized vehicles, purchasing personal
                  property, and taking part in Jobs, Missions and activities to earn Reputation
                  and cash to open up new opportunities to rise through the criminal ranks.
                  The world of Grand Theft Auto Online will constantly grow and change as
                  new content is added, creating the first ever persistent and dynamic Grand
